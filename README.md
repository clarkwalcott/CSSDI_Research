# Research for Classroom Interaction System Supporting Distributed Instruction (CISSDI) with Dale Musser:
*Hybrid course. Online and in class.*

## Current Situation:
- Zoom between Dale and Ketcham (Colmer). Chat going on through Canvas.
- Laptop sitting in a lecture hall.
- Multiple instances of Zoom cancel feedback from each other out so audio becomes an echo chamber.

## Problem: Ease of use for "technophobic" teachers. 
- How do we fix this/improve interest in tech/teaching with tech.

## Differences in Instructor endpoint vs Student endpoint changes/thoughts/design.

## Want: The ability to connect with other students through on-campus experiences.
**Want instruction everywhere for everybody (lecture hall, bedroom, kitchen, etc.)**
- You want to come to class, come to class. 
- You want to stay at home, do that.
- You want to tune in for 50 minutes at work, excellent. 
- You can't do any of the above, watch the video afterwards.
 
- All kinds of things that help students: 
  - Work on stuff
  - Get help
  - Activity areas (physical hardware)
  - Instruction together on campus

- Offline engagement, but still have online section.
- Ability to look around/get closer to/hear and understand students while remote.

## Need: Hybrid environment (like Harvard's CS50).
- Put the right technology together/provide faculty with the proper tech.
- Funding available to figure out what this should be like.

## Possible Ideas

- PTZ Camera(s) remotely controlable (Allows instructor to zoom in on someone while they're talking).

- Room mic plus another that could be passed around.

- Vertical screen as a presence in the room: 
  - Made publically available. 
  - Separate from Zoom. 
  - Different than current box in the corner of the screen. Able to convey himself better.

- Lavalier Mic

## How To Get Equipment
- Brian Mauer Director of Undergraduate Studies
- IT Program Checkout for production courses. Available for students. Ask Brian.

## Notes
- Network video compression makes camera quality matter slightly less.

- Use cases are important with any project (real-time video, etc.)

- Any thought you have, document it. (It's for posterity's sake ;D )

- e.g. 
  - I think this is a good idea
  - I think this is hurting/helping this person.

## More Ideas
- Portable vs. Permanent Installations: 
  - Campus investments kept in mind 
  - Portable would be best.

>If we have a thing on a wheeled thing (stand) that could be rolled into the room with the camera/mic/streaming hardware/etc. that could be plugged in and very little would have to be done, that would probably be ideal.
- For Example: Interactive touch display whiteboards. Problem is that these are *expensive*

- Security issues? How can we secure these wheelable stations to make them semi-permanent.

## How will I approach this problem?
- Look at the context and apply own creativity.
- Data collection? How do you want to connect with that?
- Capture the student's experience that's at a distance. 
  - How does it look/feel to them?
